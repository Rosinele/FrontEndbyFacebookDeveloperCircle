When communicating with people in the work environment it is necessary to consider who you are talking to. It is different if you are talking to your boss than to a colleague that you consider your friend. Additionally, you need to be careful with the channel that you select. Using email might be perceived as more formal than using chat. Paying attention to the context in which you are speaking or sending the message is also relevant for the way people understand.

Nonetheless, asking questions is a skill that all employees need to develop. There are different types of questions you can ask according to the situation.
